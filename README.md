### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nardi, and Iâ€™m studying Computer Science. I have six years' coding experience with multiple languages and compilers, and I'm always looking to learn more. 

I'm currently working on expanding my understanding of complex coding theories and learning more languages. Take a look around! 


## Skills 

Below are some of the languages that are a part of my primary skillset. 

 
Java |  C++  |  HTML  | CSS |  JavaScript  |  Python  |  SQL  


## Code 

Iâ€™ve included repositories from the code Iâ€™ve worked on during my time in college.
